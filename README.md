# CO-owe-and-paid-PPP

I compared delinquent taxpayer data from Colorado's Department of Revenue with those who got Paycheck Protection Program funding in Colorado. I found at least 161 Colorado companies and individuals who collectively owed millions in state back taxes still qualified for federal pandemic relief loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). 

The findings were used in this story for 9News: https://www.9news.com/article/news/investigations/ppp-loans-colorado-tax-delinquents/73-97c62384-6392-458a-bd1d-5152226458d6

The R file "Delinquent taxes R practice_2" has most of my process for how I did the analysis. That lives within the "Analysis" folder. 

DOR data lives in the "DOR delinquent data" folder.

PPP data used for the analysis was too large to upload to GitHub and lives here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jW19Nj5nr4INzK60IC4n7i8_z-DzT7Yn?usp=sharing

You can download the data for yourself from the SBA website here: https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia
